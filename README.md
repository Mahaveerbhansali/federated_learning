Introduction
This repository contains a Federated Learning-based approach to predicting diseases from symptom data. The model utilizes TensorFlow Federated (TFF) to train a decentralized neural network across multiple simulated clients while maintaining data privacy. Additionally, it includes comparisons with traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes to highlight the advantages of Federated Learning.
